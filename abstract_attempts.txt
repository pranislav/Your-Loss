Aren't these cute little cells adorable? They'd try anything to help with your loss. Just tell them what it is and they'll learn to form patterns that minimize it. Each of them has its own little secret... though they don't seem to care much about whether you'll find out.

Engineer your loss function that will guide these cells to organize into wild patterns. 

Or just have fun and try randomly initialized net until 

Aren't these cute little cells adorable? But believe them not a second, these beasts doing nought but trying to game these smartass gpt-coded losses. 

Welcome to this ___ little ecosystem, you're now a part of it. There are cells, their net and you with these losses. 

In this neural cellular automaton playgroun, you can try to tweak the loss function in pursuit of striking patterns, but beware - these cells have their own mind. Maybe just let them amuse you with intricate shapes arisen from random weights initialization.

In neural cellular automata, you don't set the rules, you teach them. But the learning objective can be too vague or can be gamed... once you
